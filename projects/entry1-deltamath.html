                The mimic a website project was a stressful but enjoyable experience for me. Eventhough, I struggled through some thing within this project I was able to learn the mistake I been making and be able to improve on them. In this project I decide to mimic DeltaMath since it a website that I go on constantly to do homework with. I think I did a pretty decent job of mimicing the website but there are still some thing that I can improve on. This project overall was to assest our skills within HTML and CSS which help us put the thing we've learn into making a website. During the mid-winter recess I started the project and left off when we got back to school where I had a general Idea of how my website was going to be. During the first couple days alot of planning was to be made before I continue to work on my project. There still something that I wonder if I can do but it requires backend code which we're only focusing on the front end which is how it look like.  
            </p> 
            <p>
                
                I began my project by planning my stuff out and during the nights that we are working on our project. I broken my project down into sectiona as such the tool bars, picures and login, and the general look. I worked on each section through the nights we were given so I'm able to keep a quick past when I'm doing my project; however, midway during my working time I was pointed out by a couple of my friend that I was doing thing incorrectly which I had to correct over time. The slow down my process which was what I was planned to do but it's a graceful learning period for me to improve.   
            </p>
            <p>
                During my first night, I worked on the bar which I rather successfully did really easily, but as I was pointed out that my code was really messy where I haven't include proper name or lable for each div I was  doing which confused me up of what I was working on. This was a huge mistake that had made where I was at one point of going crazy since I wasn't able to understand what was I doing. As I slowly mess around I was able to recieve help from friend so I am able to finish what I was doing   
            </p>
            <p>
                During my second work day, I worked on my image and the text that I was going to put within the screen. I did alot of planning out the code of how the images was going to be but scrapped it because I have to make my code dynamic to control my screen which I stayed with static. I also create the basic outline box for the login screen where I have to figure out the position which I have to put the box in, but I was rather successful and complete the task.   
            </p>
            <p>
                I struggled with the third day, I spend countless hour trying to figure out how to put a box within a box by using div, but I was rather stupid since this was before I label my div which causes me big issues where I'm unable to keep track of what I was doing. I was finally able to figure out that being simple is the way to go where If I try to do something complex I will dig myself a bigger whole then I am already. I kept it simple which did ruin some of the quilty of the website that I was presented with. That one portion that I need to improve on.   
            </p>  
            <p>
                One thing that I still need to work on is the elements that are within the boxes and images. I was currently unable to finish the border for both of them. I tried using border and gave a certain amount of pixel but It was work when I do anything nor when I try adding colors. This is one part I still need to debugg.   
            </p>  
            <p>
                This project is rather fun but stressful where I fail to be able to do my project due to my messy work. I realized now that being able to label your code make my life so much more easier where I also need to comment which is something that I can apply to the next project that Ill be working on. This a great experience for me to improve and learn as a person.   
            </p>
