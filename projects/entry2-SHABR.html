            <h1 class="margin text-center">SHABR</h1>
            <p>
                I really enjoy making the SHABR project. The project proves some diffculty for me but I was able to push through and complete my website. At first I really wanted to make my website the best website it can really be, but reailty smacks me in the face after I realized I have limiations. I pictured my perfect website of what I really want; however, when I started working on it I wasn't able to do it. I was told that I should make my MVP (Minimum viable product) first then work on the things I wanted to have. Being able to realized what limiation you have gave me the motivation to create a website of what I can do not what I can imagine. I was able to learn a really important lessons from this don't imagine but do it and do what you can do.
                
            </p> 
            <p>
                I began my project but looking for website design that I want to mimic, but the ones I see was too complex and hard for me to acomplish so I just mimic to formatt that was provided to me. I drew a outline of what my origial website was going to be like, but I scrape the example complety because the skills that was required was in my possession at the current moment. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                During my first day of work, I tried making the navgation bar/tool bar. I came up with a great Idea to make a scroll bar that scroll from the side. I make the original navbar and started to tinker with it and find way for it to scroll from the side. After awhile, I wasn't able to find the solution I need to make the bar and ask a friend for help. I was told that inorder to make the bar scroll from the side it requries a bit of Javascript which I haven't learned yet. Later on I decide to keep it simple and worry about that later. I have to finish my MVP before working on anything else.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                At my second day, I work on the body and structure of the website and planned out how should I organized my information. In order for me to make a awesome website I need to put stuff onto it. I started copying and pasting the inforamtion that I was provided into a Jumbotron; however, something keep me atray from what I was doing. Looking at the website I really wasn't enjoying the  structure that my website was placed and want it to be placed in the position I want. I thinker which where it was put but I wasn't able to get it to work. As  fustrated as I am, I have to remind myself to do what you can and make your MVP before anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                After I put all my information into my website, I have to work on the CSS. Now Idea started flooding into my mind of what I want it to be but there are still things that Im unable to acomplish with the knowledge I currently have right now. I work on making thing simple and get the requirement of the website in like adding a media query and etc. I change the color and position of many thing and things came out better then what I really expected to be.
                
            </p>  
            <p>
                One thing I have to realized is that everyone have their own strength and we learn at different paces from one another. Therefore we should make thing that beyond our reach and make thing that what I really can do. I can always improve on the  project I have whenever I'm able to.
            </p>  
            <p>
                
                This project is stressful but I was able to learn alot from it and be more independent because I'm working by myself because of the current pandamic that is going  on. No matter how much you want your project to be perfect you have to get the base line your MVP before anything else. This is a great learning experience for me.
            </p>
